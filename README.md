# BinSearch4OWASP20th
My talk about Blind SQL Injection using Binary Search and the scripts in python related


There is the talk I did in the OWASP 20th aniversary and 3 scripts:

 1-POC.py
To validate if you have a true and a false statement identified

  2-Sequential.py
 This is a traditional Blind SQL injection 
 
  3-Binary.py
 This is the way I find to aply Binary Search in my Blind SQL injection
 
 
 Hope you enjoy them
 
 Thanks to Carlos Ganoza to encourage me to publish thi work.
